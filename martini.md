# Martini

* 50 ml **Tanqueray gin**
* 15 ml **extra dry vermouth**
* 1 **olive** or twist of **lemon zest**

Stir all the ingredients with cubed ice for 60 seconds. Strain into a chilled martini glass and garnish with an olive or a twist of lemon zest.

Tread carefully - you are in the presence of the undisputed king of the cocktail world. What is it that makes a Martini so iconic? Universally revered as the driving force behind cocktail culture itself and twisted and embellished to within an inch of its life, there's a good chance that the first cocktail you've ever heard of was a Martini. How can one drink command such a huge share of the cocktail pie?

It's hard to place a finger on exactly what it is that makes a Martini so great. For many, it is likely to be the glass that it's served in. Officially named a "cocktail glass", the iconic v-shaped bowl on a stem is inextricably connected to the drink itself, so much so that through the 1980s and 90s, virtually any drink served in a martini glass was called an "[insert flavour here] Martini".

David A. Embury describes the Martini in *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* (1948) as "the most perfect of aperitif cocktails", and it's certainly true that the botanical, bordering on medicinal, properties of the drink open up the palate in a way like no other.

If you really want to know what is so special about a Martini, take a seat in a grand hotel bar, the American Bar at the Savoy in London, or the NoMad Hotel in New York are both perfect, and order one. If you can't make it there, try making one from my recipe above.

For some folk the drink is surprisingly strong (it's nothing like the "Apple Martini" that you were served by the wannabe cocktail bartender in the local pub when you were 18!), and it often takes a few attemps to really engage with it. But at one time or another, something special will happen: the drink will make perfect sense, the veil will be lifted and it will become incredibly appealing - suddenly the simple combination of only two ingredients will seem like the most obvious synergy of flavours in the world. It is perhaps the combination of simplicity and magic that makes the Martini such a holy sanctity amongst followers.

As for the origins of this drink, well, as you would expect from a cocktail as magical as this one, they are a matter of great contest. The facts are as follows... The "Martini" pre-dates the "Dry Martini" (more on differences shortly). The Martini is probably based on the Martinez, which in turn is more than likely based on the Manhattan. Where the name "Martini" came from is not fully known, but it's generally accepted that the Martini &amp; Rossi (vermouth) company promoted a Martinez made with Martini vermouth; the name change promptly followed.

The earliest reference to a Martini Cocktail that I know of comes from Wehman's *Bartender's Guide* (1891) by Henry J. Wehman:

> (Use large bar glass) Fill the glass with ice, 2 or 3 dashes gum syrup, 2 or 3 dashes Bitter, 1 dash of curaçoa, ½ wine glassful of Old Tom Gin, ½ wine glassful of vermouth.
  
It sounds suspiciously like a Martinez, and so it corroborates the link between the two drinks nicely.
